    "Despite her noble qualities, Hikari is not without flaws. Her empathy, while a cornerstone of her leadership, sometimes leaves her vulnerable.

The destruction left her haunted by guilt and grief, emotions she channels into her mission to prevent such tragedies from befalling others.",
    "As she ventured into the wider world, Hikari discovered that her light-based abilities were tied to ancient myths about a prophesied 'Radiant Light' who would unite fractured lands.

    "Her influence extends beyond her immediate actions. Stories of her courage and compassion spread like wildfire, inspiring resistance movements and uniting divided factions. While some view her as a savior, others see her as a disruptor of the status quo, adding layers of complexity to her role as a leader."
